The Reynolds number represents the ratio between [[inertial forces]] and viscous forces of a fluid or gas. It is dependent on the [[Viscosity]], Density and flow speed of the fluid, the [[Characteristic Length ( m )]] of the boundaries.
$$ Re = \frac{u \cdot L_c}{\nu} = \frac{\rho \cdot u \cdot L_c}{\mu}$$
$\rho \dots \text{density of the fluid }[\frac{kg}{m^3}]$
$u \dots \text{flow speed } [\frac{m}{s}]$
$L_c \dots \text{characteristic length } [m]$
$\mu \dots \text{dynamic viscosity of the fluid }[Pa \cdot s]$
$\nu \dots \text{kinematic viscosity of the fluid } [\frac{m^2}{s}]$
### Distinction between laminar and turbulent flow
This #dimensionless number can be used to predict if it is probable to encounter [[Turbulent Flow]] or [[Laminar Flow]] in some region of the flow studied.

- **Laminar Flow ( $Re \le 2300$ )**
	Laminar Flow
	
- **Turbulent Flow ( $Re > 2300$ )**
	Having high Reynolds numbers means viscous forces are dominated by inertial forces. In this situation edies and vortices
