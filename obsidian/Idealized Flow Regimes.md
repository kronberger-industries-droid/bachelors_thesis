### Differentiate the flow regimes
There are three different idealized flow regimes which can be distinguished by the value of their [[Knudsen number ( 1 )]].

- **Continuum regime ( $Kn \le 0.001$ )**
	In this regime the interactions of particles in the medium are much more frequent than the interactions of particles with the boundaries of the duct. This makes it possible to describe the fluid itself as an continuous medium.
	[[Navier-Stokes equations]] govern the calculations in this regime.
	
- **Slip regime ( $0.001 \le Kn \le 0.1$ )**
	Increasing Knudsen numbers mean the mean free path becomes comparable to the characteristic length scale. In this regime assumptions for continuum flow still hold, but there are deviations especially near the boundaries. Where continuum mechanics assume no slip conditions on the boundary, in this regime slip on the boundary must be factored in.
	
- **Transition regime ( $0.1 \le Kn \le 10$ )**
	This regime is a middle ground between continuum and fully molecular flow. Neither the continuum assumptions of fluid dynamics nor the free molecular flow assumptions hold completely. The interactions between the gas molecules and the boundaries are significant, and the flow characteristics may vary widely.
	
- **Molecular regime ( $Kn \ge 10$ )**
	In this regime the mean free path is much larger than the dimensions of boundaries. This leads to the fact that particle interactions themselves become negligible in comparison to the interaction of particles with the boundary.
