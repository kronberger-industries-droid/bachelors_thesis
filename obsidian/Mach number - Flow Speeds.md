#### Subsonic Flow
At every part of the duct other then the #throat moves at #subsonic speeds. 
#### Sonic Flow
In converging Ducts #sonic flow is a limit phenomenon for converging ducts which only is possible when a diverging section follows, creating a section with a minimum in cross section which is called the #throat.
#### Supersonic Flow
Its not possible to achieve #supersonic flow inside of a converging duct. This stems from the fact that for #subsonic conditions the velocity increases while traveling through the duct. Once the velocity crosses #sonic speeds this characteristic changes to the opposite. Now the velocity would decrease again, which now limits the gases velocity to #subsonic velocities and in the limit to #sonic speeds.
